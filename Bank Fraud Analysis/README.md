# Bank Fraud Transactions – Fraud Detection Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of bank transactions to identify and visualize potential fraud patterns. Using SQL for data exploration and cleaning, and Tableau for interactive visualization, the dashboard helps users monitor fraud risk across different regions and transaction characteristics.

Data used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle - Bank Transaction Dataset Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection)

## Objectives

- Identify which customer demographics are most associated with high-risk transactions, including occupation and location.

- Uncover patterns in transaction behavior (such as amount, time, and device used) that may indicate potential fraud.

- Surface trends in fraud scores to help prioritize monitoring efforts and support fraud prevention strategies.
