# Bank Fraud Transactions – Fraud Detection Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of bank transactions to identify and visualize potential fraud patterns. Using SQL for data exploration and cleaning, and Tableau for interactive visualization, the dashboard helps users monitor fraud risk across different regions and transaction characteristics.

Data used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle - Bank Transaction Dataset Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection)

## Objectives

- Identify which customer demographics are most associated with high-risk transactions, including occupation and location.

- Uncover patterns in transaction behavior (such as amount, time, and device used) that may indicate potential fraud.

- Surface trends in fraud scores to help prioritize monitoring efforts and support fraud prevention strategies.
  
## Data Processing & Visualization Tools

Google Sheets – formatting and data prep

SQL (BigQuery) – data cleaning and flag generation

Tableau – data visualization

##  Business Insights

Based on the findings of this analysis, the following insights emerge:

- High-risk occupations and locations should be monitored more closely, as certain job roles and states showed a higher concentration of elevated fraud scores.

- Most fraudulent activity occurred at high-range transaction amounts, suggesting that fraudsters may be attempting high risk, high reward transactions.

These insights can help the fraud prevention team tailor detection rules, allocate monitoring resources more effectively, and proactively address emerging fraud patterns.

## What I'd Do Next

Learn to build a machine learning model (R or Python) that can classify transactions based on historical fraud patterns.
