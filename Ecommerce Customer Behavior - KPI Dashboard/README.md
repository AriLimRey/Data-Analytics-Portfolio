# E-commerce Customer Behavior â€“ KPI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior on an e-commerce platform using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to optimize product sales tactics by extracting key business insights and creating an interactive KPI dashboard that summarizes customer behavior, engagement, and sales performance. 

Data used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle - Ecommerce Consumer Behavior Analysis Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salahuddinahmedshuvo/ecommerce-consumer-behavior-analysis-data)

- Evaluate the impact of marketing levers like discounts, advertisements, and loyalty programs on customer engagement and conversion rates.

- Identify actionable KPIs for improving revenue and retention, such as average order value (AOV), product return rates, and customer satisfaction scores.

## Business Insights

- Optimize for Desktop Users: With desktop being the dominant device, ensure the desktop shopping experience is fast, user-friendly, and personalized.

- Discount Strategy: Offer strategic discounts or time-limited promos can help boost conversions.

- Loyalty Program Optimization: With nearly half of customers enrolled, test rewards tiers or exclusive benefits to increase lifetime value.

- Improve Product Descriptions: Adding videos, clear specs, more photos, or reviews may speed up decisions.

## What I'd Do Next

- Segment KPIs by customer demographics (e.g., age, income level, education) to uncover more targeted insights for marketing and personalization strategies.

- Incorporate time-based trends to track KPI changes over months or seasons, helping identify opportunities for optimizing campaigns or promotions.

- Predict purchase intent or churn likelihood by exploring more advanced analytics or machine learning models as I gain experience.
