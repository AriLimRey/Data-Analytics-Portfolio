# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Ari! With a background in procurement and supply chain, I'm making a career transition into data analytics to follow my passion for working with data, uncovering insights, and solving real-world problems.

Over the past several months, I’ve focused on building foundational skills in Google Sheets, SQL, R, and Tableau through self-led projects that explore topics I care deeply about including fintech, investing, fraud prevention, and e-commerce. Each project reflects my curiosity, analytical thinking, and desire to create something useful and practical.

As I grow into this new path, I’m excited to keep learning, collaborating, and building tools that support data-driven decision making. I believe good analysis tells a story and I’m here to tell better ones with data.

### Check out my projects:

## - [E-commerce Customer Behavior - KPI Dashboard](./Ecommerce%20Customer%20Behavior%20-%20KPI%20Dashboard)

![Ecommerce Customer KPIs](Ecommerce%20Customer%20Behavior%20-%20KPI%20Dashboard/Ecommerce%20Customer%20KPIs.png)  

This project analyzes customer behavior on an e-commerce platform using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to optimize product sales tactics by extracting key business insights and creating an interactive KPI dashboard that summarizes customer behavior, engagement, and sales performance.

## - [Bank Fraud Analysis](./Bank%20Fraud%20Analysis)

![Bank Fraud Risk](Bank%20Fraud%20Analysis/Bank%20Fraud%20Risk.png)

This project analyzes a dataset of bank transactions to identify and visualize potential fraud patterns. Using SQL for data exploration and cleaning, and Tableau for interactive visualization, the dashboard helps users monitor fraud risk across different regions and transaction characteristics.

## - [Financial Statement Analysis](./Financial%20Statement%20Analysis)

![Financial Statement Comparison Summary](Financial%20Statement%20Analysis/Financial%20Statement%20Comparison%20Summary.png)

This project compares the financial health and performance of two high-growth companies that went IPO (initial public offering) in 2021: Rivian (ticker symbol: RIVN), and Robinhood (ticker symbol: HOOD). It provides important financial information from past years to aid in predicting the company's future outlook. The goal is to simply analyze each company’s fundamentals and create a sensitivity analysis using metrics commonly used by investors and analysts, including revenue growth, margins, debt levels, and free cash flow.

## - [P2P Lending Risk](./P2P%20Lending%20Risk)

![P2P Lending Risk](P2P%20Lending%20Risk/P2P%20Lending%20Risk.png)

This project explores peer-to-peer (P2P) lending data from Prosper, a U.S.-based online lending platform. The goal was to identify risk trends in borrower demographics and understand which types of borrowers may present higher or lower default risk. This exploratory analysis focuses on income, occupation, DTI ratio, homeownership, and borrower location using data from 2010 to 2014.
